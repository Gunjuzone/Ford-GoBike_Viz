## Dataset
The forgobike dataset was analyzed for this project. The forgobike dataset contains information about individual bike-sharing trips in the San Francisco Bay area.

To improve the findings, I cleaned the datset for several tidiness and quality issues.

New column was created for age of the bike users.
I converted the start-time and end-time data types from string to datetime.
I converted the duration in seconds to minutes
I split the start and end date to start month, day and hour.
Missing values were removed from start station id, start station name, end station id, end station name, member birth year, and member gender.


## Summary of Findings

1 - There are more male users of bikes

2 - There are more customers than subscribers

3 - From the two types of distinct users, customer users spend more time cycling than subscribers. Of the three types of genders, male gender spend more time cycling than other and female.

4 - Generally, across all the genders and subscribers, 20 to 50 years old are very active riders <br>

5 - Eventhough, thursday is the busiest day for cycling, people tend to ride longer on weekends <br>

6 - Male between the age of 20 and 80 usually cycle for around 100 minutes. <br>

7 - Others gender of age 22 to 60 years are very active with cycling, tghey cycle for aaround 40 minutes <br>

Female of age 20 to 60 years show similar cycling tendency to male but they cycle for lesser minutes <br>

8 - There is no noticeable relationship between age and the duration of cycling.

## Key Insights for Presentation

I focused on the distribution of the type of users that use the gobike system, their genders an age. 

I checked if they favour a particular day for cycling and how long they spend cycling.

There are so much outliers, the outliers made it look like other gender ride more time than male and felmale customers.

Male customers on average cycle more than females.
